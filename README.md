# Stroke Rehab and Microsoft Kinect Project

<h5><b>Luke Dubois, Anita Perr, Claire Kearney-Volpe and Eozin Che</b></h5><br/>

<b>Aims: </b> <br/>

1) Contribute to the understanding of auditory feedback as a method of proprioceptive rehab.<br/>

Significance-We hope to build on previous research suggesting that auditory feedback of joint motions may be substitute for proprioceptive input.<br/>

2) Demonstrate the efficacy of using commercially available and financially accessible technology (the Microsoft Kinect) <br/>

3) Increase compliance and patient-OT communications of at-home exercises thru exercise data storage and retrieval by clinicians. <br/><br/>
