# Stroke Rehab and Microsoft Kinect Project

<h3><b>Luke Dubois, Anita Perr, Claire Kearney-Volpe and Eozin Che</b></h3><br/>

<b>Aims: </b> <br/>

1) Contribute to the understanding of auditory feedback as a method of proprioceptive rehab.<br/>

Significance-We hope to build on previous research suggesting that auditory feedback of joint motions may be substitute for proprioceptive input.<br/>

2) Demonstrate the efficacy of using commercially available and financially accessible technology (the Microsoft Kinect) <br/>

3) Increase compliance and patient-OT communications of at-home exercises thru exercise data storage and retrieval by clinicians. <br/><br/>

<b>Proposal: </b><br/>

We are interested in using the Microsoft Kinect v2 to 1) develop game-like activities for occupational therapy clients that are recovering from a stroke and 2) collect information about client performance to monitor progress and compliance. We are using the Kinect because it detects joint position, which is crucial in therapies that aim to rehabilitate a person’s sense of their body in space. The activities will utilize engaging narrative, audio and visual feedback about a client’s joint positioning during adapted physical therapy exercises. These types of feedback are meant to reinforce behaviors that increase proprioception and motor functioning. We are targeting clients with a range of motor and cognitive function. The activities will range in difficulty and encourage balance, extension and repetition of adaptive movement. We hope to show that Kinect enhanced rehab activities increase engagement and are suitable for doing at-home exercises, as well as, in collaboration with Occupational or Physical therapists. <br/>
<br/>

<b>For the project we propose four main phases that have distinct timelines and goals. At this time, they are as follows:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Familiarization with Current Treatment (Completed by mid-August)</b><br/>

During this initial Information gathering stage, we will speak with clinicians and observe OT and PT treatments done in inpatient and outpatient settings. We will meet with these clinicians at NYU and build out schematics/user flows based on our observations (see attached example). <br/><br/>

<b>Product Development (Completed by August 15th)</b><br/>

Prototyping/Development of application will begin once we have completed researching. The application will be built in openFrameworks, and client joint position data will be gathered using the Kinect.<br/><br/>

<b>Clinical Research (Completed by September 15th)</b><br/>

Once the software is built, we will apply for IRB approval and build in a HIPPA compliant server portion that will allow for in-home client data to be recorded and accessible by PT/OTs. Our goals here are 1) to create a database containing patient data from OT and PT therapies and 2) interview clinicians and clients about their experiences and implement a quantitative measure of its effectiveness.<br/><br/>
